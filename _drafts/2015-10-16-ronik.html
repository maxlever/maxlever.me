    While working as a co-op at <a target="_blank" href="http://ronikdesign.com">Ronik</a>, I redesigned and built mobile layouts to complement Ronik's existing desktop website design, and made the site responsive. For this task, I adapted the existing components of the desktop site to small and medium-sized devices, while retaining the same style; I also added some components (such as the dropdown menu) specifically for mobile interaction. In addition, I designed and built a new Awards page with  Katie Soldau, another co-op. We aimed to emulate the same look and feel as the other pages, by reusing the components and the typography of the site, and creating an information hierarchy that made sense.

    Through this process, we also converted the website to using the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.webhook.com/">Webhook</a> CMS, <a target="_blank" href="http://ronik-design.github.io/slush-stencil/">Slush Stencil</a> scaffolding, <a target="_blank" href="http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/">Swig</a> templating, and <a target="_blank" href="http://stylus-lang.com/">Stylus</a> styles.
