<p>I created this piece for my 2D Foundation class last Spring. The assignment was to make a piece that uses a grid, and that creates a democracy between black and white. I decided to break up the grid with concentric circles and noise, and by offsetting the entire piece by an inch.</p>

<p> Made with Photoshop and Illustrator.</p>
