  Scout is Northeastern University's student-led design studio, which provides creative solutions to NU-affiliated clients and the Northeastern community. It also hosts events all across campus to expand the use of design at Northeastern.

  I worked with a designer at Scout to design the new site, and built it in HTML/CSS and PHP, launching it in time for their first event at Northeastern.
  </p>
  <p>I wrote a custom Wordpress theme in PHP, and ran a DigitalOcean staging server for the Scout team to provide feedback and add content. After some difficulties navigating Apache and MySQL, I transitioned the site to NU's shared server.</p>
