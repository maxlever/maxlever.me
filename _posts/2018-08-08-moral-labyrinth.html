		Would you trust a robot trained on your behaviors?
		How will we know when a machine becomes sentient?
		What does it mean to be moral?
	</i>
</p>
<p>
	Moral Labyrinth is an interactive art installation that takes shape as a physical walking labyrinth, comprised of philosophical questions, and an individualized “digital” labyrinth on an accompanying laptop. It is inspired by questions in moral philosophy and the value alignment problem in artificial intelligence.
</p>
<p>
	Concept by <a href="https://sarahwnewman.com/">Sarah Newman</a>, an artist at <a href="https://metalabharvard.github.io/">metaLAB (at) Harvard</a>.
</p>
<p>
	My role was to design and develop the digital labyrinth, and integrate a repurposed thermal printer to make custom illustrations for users.
