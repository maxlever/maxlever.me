    For a web design class taught by <a href="http://turnwall.com/">Alex Turnwall</a>, I designed and built a site about the history of blues music, starting from its roots in Western Africa, up until the era of the electric guitar. One of the biggest challenges was designing a simple navigation system and information hierarchy that conveyed all the information I wanted.
