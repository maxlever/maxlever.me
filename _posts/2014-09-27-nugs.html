<p>Northeastern's 2014 Global Summit focused on the mistakes that led to the 2008 financial crisis, the lessons learned from it, and how it can be prevented in the future.</p>
</p>
<p>I joined their social media team in Fall 2013 and was asked to design their logo.</p>

<p>After many sketches and meetings with the founders, I decided on a simple abstraction of a globe shape into 4 intersecting curves, along with Northeastern's type and a cursive title.</p>
