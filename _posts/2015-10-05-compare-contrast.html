            In the Fall of 2015 I took a History of Graphic Design class taught by Prof. Doug Scott. One of our projects was to analyze and compare two design pieces in history; and create a poster which lays out the compare / contrast essay and displays the two pieces. My poster compares a 1909 piece created by the founder of Futurism, F.T. Marinetti, and an absurdist play by Ionesco laid out by Massin. Both designers are pioneers in expressive typography.
