    In Fall 2015, I took a History of Graphic Design class taught by Douglas Scott. The above interactive is a digital version I made of a physical accordeon I designed and printed. The accordeon showcases and analyzes the work of American graphic designer Herb Lubalin.

    Another one of our projects was to analyze and compare two design pieces in history; and create a poster that lays out the compare / contrast essay and displays the two pieces. My poster compares a 1909 piece created by the founder of Futurism, F.T. Marinetti, and an absurdist play by Ionesco laid out by Massin. Both designers are pioneers in expressive typography.
