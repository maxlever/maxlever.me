    I'm currently a founding member of Scout Labs, a team within <a href="http://neu.edu/scout">Scout</a>, Northeastern's student-run design studio. Launched in Fall 2015, Scout Labs is a social innovation initiative that uses the design thinking methodology to define and research social issues in Boston, as well as prototype and test potential solutions.
</p>
<p>
    We started our project at the beginning of the academic year, when we conducted background research on social issues in Boston and identified potential areas of focus for our project. We looked at topics such as education, food, transportation, the achievement gap, and financial literacy. After reaching out to various academic and field experts, we decided to focus on promoting healthy food behavior in low income communities.

    To gain a deeper understanding of the problem, we conducted interviews at grocery stores in our target neighborhood, talked to professors, and talked to other groups working in this space. After gathering all of this information, we analyzed it and began to develop some insights. Based on these insights, we decided than a design intervention at the point of purchase could be both feasible and valuable. Corner stores are a great setting for this kind of change in behavior, because of their strong ties with the community and their flexibility. Below is a "journey map" of a corner store customer; using this tool we were able to identify the intervention point.

    After more research, we decided to design a pilot program to promote the purchase of produce in community-oriented corner stores. We reached out to several corner store owners, and are currently partnering with one owner to create a food display placed in a prominent location within the store. As we implement this program, we hope to tracking sales from the corner stores and follow up with participants in the program to be able to measure any impact.
