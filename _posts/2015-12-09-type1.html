    I took a typography class taught by Ernesto Aparicio, an Argentinian designer who worked at the French publishing house Ã‰ditions du Seuil. For one project, I designed a poster using photographs of typography details I took in Boston. Deviating from the original assignment specification, which prescribed a square grid, I decided to overlay a 3-point perspective grid to make the composition more dynamic.

    For the project below, the brief was to make a poster that showcases a typeface.
