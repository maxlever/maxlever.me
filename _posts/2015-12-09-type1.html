    In Fall 2015, I took a typography class taught by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Ernesto-Aparicio/">Ernesto Aparicio</a>. For one project, I designed a poster using photographs of typography details I took in Boston. Deviating from the original assignment specification, which prescribed a square grid, I decided to overlay a 3-point perspective grid to make the composition more dynamic.

    For the project below, the brief was to make a poster that showcases a typeface. I chose Erik Spiekermann's Meta because it's a pragmatic yet is also personal, and makes for an interesting visual deconstruction. Notice how the stems often end with a slight bend.
