    While on co-op at <a href="http://ronikdesign.com">Ronik</a>, I worked on a team which developed a responsive marketing site for <a href="http://transformingmedicine.org">Transforming Medecine</a>, an NGO that matches people with life-threatening illnesses to the best treatments for their condition. I created the site using our own website scaffolding tool <a href="http://ronik-design.github.io/slush-stencil/">Slush Stencil</a>, <a href="http://stylus-lang.com/">Stylus</a> for styles, and deployed it to a <a href="http://www.webhook.com/">Webhook</a> CMS.
