  <p>Hext is a game I made with my team at the 2014 Global Game Jam in January. The topic was "We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are."</p>

  <p>You play as a vain and ill-mannered human who has been hexed into a bat, and who must learn to navigate the environment using echolocation.</p> 
  <p>We coded the game in C# using the Unity Game Engine, and used Photoshop for the art assets and animations.</p>
