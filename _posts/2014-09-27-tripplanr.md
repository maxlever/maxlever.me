<p>During the Cal Hacks hackathon in UC Berkeley (October 3rd - 5th), we built a website that allows you to plan trips in a new city. When you visit a new city, you may not know what places to visit, how to get there, or how much time it will take. TripPlanr (our working title) was our solution to this problem. You can choose your start and end location, as well as the attractions you want to go to, and the app gives you the most effective path and directions.</p>

Our team of 2 developed the entire app with Ruby on Rails on the backend and jQuery and Bootstrap on the frontend. We used the Google Maps and Google Places APIs to generate the destinations, the map, and the directions.
