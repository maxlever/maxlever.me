  <p>As a developer at <a href="http://neu.edu/scout">Scout</a>, I built a website for INSHORE (International Network for the Study of Rocky Intertidal Ecosystems), a group of scientists dedicated to climate change research through the lens of marine sustainability.</p>

    <p>After making a static HTML prototype, I built a custom Wordpress theme in PHP and continued developing on a live staging server so that both the Scout team and the client could see my progress.</p>
    <p>The most challenging part was creating the map on the About page. I initially tried to use jQuery with the Google Maps API, but because it had to dynamically sync with the MySQL database, I ended up using a modified version of a plugin called GeoMashup. (However, this jQuery knowledge came in handy at <a href="{{ '/dev/tripplanr' | prepend:site.baseurl }}">Cal Hacks</a>)</p>
