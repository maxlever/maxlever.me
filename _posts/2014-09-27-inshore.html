  <p>The International Network for the Study of Rocky Intertidal Ecosystems (INSHORE) is a group of scientists dedicated to climate change research through the lens of marine sustainability. Their goal is to educate younger generations about climate change, and build a community of like-minded individuals, and advance research in the field.</p>
  <p>INSHORE enlisted Scout, Northeastern's design studio, to create their website. I collaborated with a designer at Scout to develop the website in HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP.</p>

    <p>After the designer gave me the mockups, I worked with her to create an HTML prototype to show to the client. </p>
    <p>Once they approved the prototype, I transitioned the website to a local WordPress server. Like for the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/web/scout">Scout</a> website, I continued development on a live server so that both the Scout team and the client could see my progress.</p>
    <p>I added Custom Post Types and custom taxonomies in the PHP backend to structure all of the information. The most challenging part of this project was creating the map on the About page. I initially started to use jQuery in order to use the Google Maps API and create the map myself, but because the map had to dynamically sync with the WordPress database, I ended up using the GeoMashup plugin to do most of the heavy lifting, and modified the pre-existing code to fit the requirements and style. (However, this jQuery knowledge came in handy at <a href="{{ '/web/tripplanr' | prepend:site.baseurl }}">Cal Hacks</a>!)</p>
