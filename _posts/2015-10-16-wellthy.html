    While on co-op at <a href="http://ronikdesign.com">Ronik Design</a>, I worked on a team that designed and developed a web application for Wellthy. Wellthy is a startup which provides assistance to people caring for their ailing loved ones by connecting them with caregivers. Working alongside Wellthy's back-end developers, I focused on developing the front-end interface for both customers and caregivers.
</p>
<p>
    We started by creating a static version independent of the back-end using our own tool <a href="http://ronik-design.github.io/slush-stencil/">Slush Stencil</a> for scaffolding; we styled the site using <a href="http://stylus-lang.com/">Stylus</a>, and made templates using <a href="http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/">Swig</a>. Once the back-end was completed, we integrated our pages into the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> templating system and connected our static site to the back-end.
