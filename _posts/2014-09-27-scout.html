  Scout is Northeastern University's student-led design studio, which works with NU-affiliated clients and the Northeastern community. It also hosts events all across campus to expand design thinking at Northeastern.
  </p>
  <p>
  I worked with a designer at Scout to design the new site, then developed it in HTML, CSS and PHP, and launched it in under 2 weeks, in time for their first event at Northeastern.
  </p>
  <div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6"><img src="/images/Scout5.png"></div>
  <div class="col-sm-6"><p>I started out by created a static prototype in HTML.</p>
  <p>After 2 days, I installed WordPress on a local server, created a MySQL database and dove into the PHP backend.</p>
  <p>To achieve the specific styles and layouts that were needed, I started out with a barebones starter theme called <a href="http://underscores.me/">Underscores</a>, which I integrated with Bootstrap. Out of that, I made a custom Scout theme in PHP. For each HTML page in my prototype, I made a PHP page template for WordPress, and added a CSS stylesheet.</p>
  <p>Like for <a href="{{ '/web/inshore' | prepend: site.url }}">INSHORE</a>, I created Custom Post Types and taxonomies to structure and organize the content. I also used the Advanced Custom Fields plugin to make some static content editable and add functionality to certain posts.</p>
  </div>
  </div>
    <p>I then put the website on a temporary DigitalOcean server for the Scout team to see my progress, critique it and add content. Setting up a LAMP stack on a live server was one of the most challenging parts of development, since I had to work entirely in the command line.</p>
  <p>Within a week, I was ready to transition to Northeastern's shared server. After several sleepless nights of bug-fixing, the website was online.</p>
  <p>We're planning on adding a blog soon, and we're also working on redesigning the whole site in the near future, so stay tuned!</p>
