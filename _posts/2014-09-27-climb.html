<p>My team and I made this game during the 2013 Northeastern Game Jam. The topic of the game jam was "Government Shutdown," so we decided to make a game where a government shutdown causes a massive spaceship to crash, and the player has to climb out of it.</p> 
<p>We used Photoshop for creating art assets and Multimedia Fusion as our game engine.</p>
