  My team and I made this game during the 2013 Northeastern Game Jam. The topic of the game jam was "Government Shutdown," so we decided to make a game where a government shutdown causes a massive space ship to crash. We made it using the Multimedia Fusion game engine and Photoshop for creating art assets.
