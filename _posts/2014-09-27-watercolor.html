While I was visiting my grandparents in Normandy one summer, we went on a trip to the Côte Sauvage, or "Savage Coast”, a very windy part of the Breton coast where the rocky shores and the vivid greenery make for an incredible landscape. So I took photos from several different angles and drew a few pencil sketches, and decided on this composition.

I used a technique I learned over the summer at the Corcoran College of Art and Design in Washington, D.C. to layer over each color and create a sense of depth.

<p>This is an earlier painting I created while taking a painting class at the Corcoran. I was learning to layer tones incrementally, inspired by David Dewey's work.
