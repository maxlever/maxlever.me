    This was a site built during Hack@Brown 2017, a hackathon at Brown University, with three teammates (Beatrice Huang, Vanessa Gregorchik, Tia Thomson). It displays a set of images from the Harvard Art Museum API, and when users select a piece, it displays a thematically similar current events news headline. We wanted to make browsing the news akin to browsing an art gallery.

    We used the Bing Trending Topics API to parse headlines from different news sources, and the Microsoft Cognitive Services API to analyze the text and its similarities to art descriptions from the Harvard Art Museum API. Once we gathered this information, we built this site with Polymer and Javascript to pair an image with the most thematically similar headline.

    This site won the Best Web App prize by Google at Hack@Brown.
