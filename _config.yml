  Hello! I'm a French-American student at Northeastern University, where I study Computer Science, Interactive Media, and Ethics. I've also taken courses in political science and philosophy at Sciences Po in Paris. I enjoy analyzing and building systems, whether they are graphic, technical, or conceptual.
  
  I've previously worked at:
  
  The MIT Media Lab, designing an interface which allows you to compute the emotional content of sentences, and detect sarcasm. 
  
  Ronik Design, a creative technology agency in New York, designing and developing digital experiences for clients big and small.
  
  I'm available for new collaborations starting May 2018. If you're interested in building creative and critical technologies, or just want to chat, reach me at maxlever[at]ccs.neu.edu.
