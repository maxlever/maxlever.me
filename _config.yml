  I'm a French-American student in my 4th year at Northeastern University, in Boston, where I study Computer Science and Interactive Media. I've also taken courses in political science and philosophy at Sciences Po Paris. My interests are at the confluence of design, technology, and social impact. I spend my time analyzing systems, whether they are graphic, technological, philosophical, or political. My practical experience includes design thinking, software development, interaction design, and digital/interactive art.

  Otherwise, I occupy myself by reading philosophical novels, drawing convoluted diagrams, or making lists; usually while eating crunchy pastries or bread.
