Hi! I'm Max, a French-American student in my 4th year at Northeastern University, in Boston, where I study Computer Science and Interactive Media. I've also taken courses in social and political science at Sciences Po, in Paris. My interests are at the confluence of design, technology, and social impact. I'm fascinated by complex systems, whether they are graphic, technological, or geopolitical. Much of my experience is in design thinking, interaction design, digital art, and software development. 

When I'm not working, you'll find me reading existentialist essays, drawing diagrams, or making lists; usually while eating crunchy pastries or bread.
