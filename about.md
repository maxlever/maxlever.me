Hello. I'm a French-American developer and designer. I'm currently a student in my 4th year of a B.S. in Computer Science & Interactive Media at Northeastern University, in Boston, Massachussetts. In addition, I've also taken social and political science courses at Sciences Po, in Paris, France. In general, I'm interested in social innovation, art, design, and technology, and their possible practical and theoretical combinations. Much of my experience involves design thinking, interaction design, and full-stack web development, but I strive to take varied and interdisciplinary roles. I'm currently looking for an internship in January 2017.

In my spare time, you'll find me reading existentialist novels, drawing overly complex diagrams, or enumerating things; usually while eating crunchy pastries or bread.
