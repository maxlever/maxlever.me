Hello. I'm a French-American developer and designer. I'm currently a student in my 4th year of a B.S. in Computer Science & Interactive Media at Northeastern University, in Boston, Massachussetts. In addition, I've also taken courses in social and political science at Sciences Po, in Paris, France. In general, I'm interested in social innovation, art, design, and technology, and their possible practical and theoretical combinations. Much of my experience involves design thinking, interaction and graphic design, and full-stack web development. I'm currently looking for an internship or co-op in January 2017.

In my spare time, you'll find me either reading surrealist or existentialist novels, drawing overly complex diagrams, or making to-do lists; usually while eating crunchy pastries or bread â€” and slightly embarrassed.
